This is the first modified version of the ATM script

Assuming that there are no misconception of the requirements, Part B out of ABCD is finished.

Current version: 1.3

Notes: 

++ Changed parts are commented "newly added", I might miss some but the majority of them is marked

++ Don't use this script for UML, but please use it when we move on to Part II

++ 1.0 is the original version that completely same with the blackboard published source code

There are some potential problem listed below

-- I don't really understand what is the "set" in get-sets, so I assumed it is some methods reserved for some administrator accounts. 
Emil
-- I don't know if the balance will be affected by time, such that after changing the computer's internal time when the script is running, the balance will actually change (???, sounds fucking difficult to implement)
Emil
-- I wrote this script when I am quite literally drunk, so I don't really know what im doing, would be very helpful if any of you can help me proofread the codes
Emil
-- Do we need to add some checking function in Keypad.java? For illustration: try-catch statement, numberformatexcption, illegalargumentexcption...tbh, who tf want to add expctional cases checking everytime in other file ?????????

There might be a few more that I cannot recall or think of right away.
